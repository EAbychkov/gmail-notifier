# Notice

Mail Deck (formerly Mail Deck for Gmail) is derived from Notifier for Gmail, whose Initial Developer is InBasic. It is distributed under the Mozilla Public License 1.1; see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Changes (October 2026)

- A new toolbar panel (`data/panel/`) lists every signed-in mailbox with its unread mail, a full message view and read, archive, delete and spam actions.
- `core/check.js` builds one feed per account: each account checks its own watched labels or its inbox.
- `core/repeater.js` rechecks when an account's watched labels change.
- A new settings page (`data/settings/`) replaces the old options page.
- New icons and a red badge by default.
- Renamed to Mail Deck for Gmail. The original project's install, update and uninstall pages and its older versions were removed.
- Other mail services: `core/services.js` checks Yahoo Mail, AOL Mail, Proton Mail, Yandex Mail and Mail.ru, each from its own file in `core/services/`, once the user turns it on. Renamed to Mail Deck.
